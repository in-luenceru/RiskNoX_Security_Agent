### 2. Current Features (Based on Configuration)

#### Security Monitoring Modules:
1. **Network Block Monitor** - Monitors and blocks network traffic
2. **API Log Ingestion** - Collects and processes API logs
3. **Access Monitor** - Monitors system access attempts
4. **Log Monitor** - Monitors Windows Event Logs
5. **Process Monitor** - Monitors running processes
6. **Network Monitor** - Monitors network connections
7. **Patch Monitor** - Monitors system patches
8. **Antivirus Monitor** - Integrates with ClamAV for virus scanning
9. **OS/Hardware Monitor** - Monitors system resources
10. **Vulnerability Monitor** - Scans for vulnerabilities
11. **Software Monitor** - Monitors installed software
12. **User Group Monitor** - Monitors user accounts and groups
13. **Status API Reporter** - Reports system status

#### Key Components Available:
- **ClamAV Antivirus Engine**: Full-featured antivirus with real-time scanning capabilities
- **Network Blocking**: Uses Windows hosts file and firewall rules
- **Patch Management**: Integration with Windows Update APIs
- **Comprehensive Logging**: JSON-based logging system
- **Remote API Integration**: Connects to external monitoring services

### 3. Current ClamAV Capabilities

#### clamscan.exe Features:
- **Virus Database**: Pre-installed with main.cvd, daily.cvd, and bytecode.cvd
- **File/Directory Scanning**: Recursive scanning with various options
- **Archive Support**: Scans inside compressed files
- **Real-time Detection**: Can detect viruses, malware, and PUAs
- **Quarantine Options**: Can remove, move, or copy infected files
- **Multiple File Format Support**: PE, ELF, OLE2, PDF, SWF, HTML, etc.
- **Heuristic Analysis**: Advanced threat detection capabilities
- **Configurable Limits**: File size, scan time, and resource limits

#### clamd.exe Features:
- **Daemon Mode**: Background service for real-time protection
- **Windows Service Integration**: Can be installed as Windows service
- **Network Scanner**: Can accept scan requests over network

#### freshclam.exe Features:
- **Automatic Updates**: Updates virus signature databases
- **Scheduled Updates**: Can run on schedule to keep definitions current

### 4. Current Limitations

1. **Missing Implementation Scripts**: The scripts/ directory is empty
2. **No Web Interface**: No frontend for user interaction
3. **No Python Backend**: Configuration suggests Python scripts but none exist
4. **No Centralized Control**: No single management interface
5. **Manual Configuration**: All configuration through XML files

### 5. Configuration Highlights

The system is configured to:
- Scan Downloads folder every 30 minutes
- Report to external APIs (pulse-production-2f3b.up.railway.app)
- Monitor Windows Event Logs for security events
- Block network traffic using hosts file modifications
- Collect comprehensive system metrics
- Support both local and remote logging

### 6. Security Features Ready for Implementation

#### Antivirus:
- **Engine**: ClamAV 1.4.3 (production-ready)
- **Database**: Complete signature database included
- **Capabilities**: Full file system scanning, real-time protection potential

#### Web Blocking:
- **Method**: Hosts file manipulation + firewall rules
- **Configuration**: Rule prefix "RiskNox_Block_"
- **Integration**: API-based blocking list management

#### Patch Management:
- **Integration**: Windows Update API ready
- **Configuration**: 30-day compliance window, 7-day update frequency
- **Reporting**: External API integration configured

## Implementation Requirements

Based on this analysis, we need to create:

1. **Web Frontend**: User-friendly interface for all three features
2. **Python Backend**: API server to handle frontend requests
3. **PowerShell Control Script**: Unified management interface
4. **Integration Scripts**: Connect frontend with existing ClamAV and system APIs
5. **Security Layer**: Admin authentication for patch management
6. **Documentation**: Complete usage guide

The current infrastructure provides an excellent foundation with enterprise-grade antivirus capabilities, network blocking mechanisms, and patch monitoring systems already configured.
